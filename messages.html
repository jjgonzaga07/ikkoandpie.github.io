                    Dear pie,
<br><br>
Hello pieeeee! i miss you so much! i hope you're doing well, it's so hard to not tweet about what i'm going through lately after what happened last sunday. First of all, i just wanna say sorry for everything i did, i'm sorry for lying again to keep u having peace of mind and i know it's stupid because i did that before and i did know what happened for doing that before but i still did it again and i'm so sorry for being a stupid person. it will be a lesson to me that i'll never forget like it made me think that if i really love u, i should've trust u, i should've told u everything even though i know u'll get hurt with it, because if we really love each other we'll do our best to understand each other right? i'm sorry for realizing it all too late and i do regret everything happened.                </p>

                    I'm sorry, i'm really not that good in constructing a long message HAHAHAHA u know i hate essay naman right so please wag ikaw magalit if ang pangit ng message ko na to :>> anyway i did explain the issue naman na in the twitter, i hope u trust me with everything i said there because i really hate myself right now. i'm really sorry sayo and also kay tita, i'm sorry for keeping what happened on thursday but now i'll tell you everything that happened. i did go there with a thought of telling to her everything that happened like that day u said na u'll not give me a chance na and her friend message you rin so i want to go there and talk to her in person and tell everything i think of her and what i feel about everything that happened that day. i told her na ayon, u didn't gave me chance because everything is so messy at the moment and u said u don't deserve that which is true naman like yes u deserve better, u don't deserve na maipit sa ganong situation because all u deserve is love in peace and i want to give u that but it never happened because she's still going at me. i told to her that i'm so mad at her and her friends, i blamed her for everything that happened because we'll be good right now if hindi na siya nanggulo. i know it's wrong for me to blame everything to her because this will not happened if i did cut her out before like wtf why am i so stupid nakakabwisit habang ginagawa ko tong message na to i'm crying and the reason of it is naiinis ako sa sarili ko. then nung time na uuwi na ko, her friends came and ayon i told u what happened with it naman na and natakot me umuwi non since she said to me na di ako basta basta papauwiin ng friends niya so i stayed, i'll go home na sana by 8pm but mom insist na wag na muna ako umuwi since sobra ng gabi, so i stayed that night. then tommorow morning, i only stay until night because she talked to me again and di pa rin siya sumuko non. hanggang hapon umiiyak siya sakin and she's blaming her friends for coming and nakelam ganon because i said to her na di na ko babalik ng pampanga because of it, then nung gabi na she changed like she became cold and sinabi niya na ayaw niya na raw umiyak ganooon and i told her im okay with being friends that's all because naaawa pa rin ako :<<< ayon that's why she can still ask me what's happening satin and ayon sinabi ko naman sayo na sinasagot ko siya para maumay siya and gave up because she said rin naman na gusto niya lang masaktan. yeah she gave up naman but di siya umalis ng walang gagawing ikasisira ko. ayon po yung nangyari nung thurs to friday, i'm sorry for keeping it.

                    I don't wanna end this message ng nageexplain lang about sa naging issue. I just wanna say na thank you for everything and i'm happy sa sinend mo na message using word file. you're really the only person who can make me smile and happy right now. everything u said there made me smile like the thing about perfume and also you said that you love me a little bit more than i love you? i don't think so, we can go in a debate and i can prove you wrong about that. I can sacrifice everything for you even we didn't became official, i'm really serious about us. it's weird that this situationship became my biggest heartbreak like i did loved crazy rin before but not like this where kinalimutan ko na rin sarili ko. i said this multiple times na but i feel different with you, with you i feel peace and safe. everything's better when we're okay and i think that's why i let myself became dependent sayo especially with how my mood affects depends on how you talk to me. i'll be honest na after september 21 (yung time na unang nagchat sayo si andrea) where you became so cold even sa twitter, i always feel sad kahit kinakausap mo pa rin ako because i dont feel like na ikaw yon, pinipilit ko nalang rin sarili ko na sumaya because you still giving me the time of yours to reply with all my tweets and that thing makes me happy enough na kahit cold man ikaw :>>> i just thought na if i wait babalik ka rin sa dati where you says random iloveyou and imissyou and sadly it never happened because something happened again.               </p>

                    walang araw na hindi kita iniisip lately, di man ako nagtetweet i'm just ano pinipigilan ko lang sarili ko because i think di mo na babasahin ganon because u don't want me na. i always cry and i can't stop being sad like i really love you pie, i told to yuno na what happened between us and like she told me na if i want her to message you raw ba T^T i told her no because i don't want to bother you, i agree that we both need to heal from everything. mmmm i don't think i can move on with this tbh like my feelings with you are really oa and i can't control it, i really wanna be with u for my lifetime. i want to be your number 1 fan, i want to support you with everything i got, i want you to smile with me being the main reason of it, i want to bond with you and your family, i want to be there when you're doing everything u dreamed na, i want to be by your side kapag malungkot ka, i want to hug you when you feel the worst, i want to be the person na hahanapin mo kapag feel mo wala ka ng kakampi sa mundo, i want to be the person na una mong mapagsasabihan ng mga magandang nangyari sa araw mo, i want to be the person in the future na nasa tabi mo at una mong pagsasabihan ng goodmorning paggising mo and pagsasabihan mo ng goodnight before we sleep, i want to be the person that you wanna love for your lifetime.
